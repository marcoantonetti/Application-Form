My application-form proyect. 

In this proyect you have a multi step form with a general title and description.
Each step has its own category and input types, the user can access to them by clicking on
the next and previous buttons.

User must complete some of the inputs correctly in order to advance to the next step.

There is a progress bar on top that shows the current step you are in.

All steps have a display of none except the one that is active (class = 'active'). 

This proyect is dinamically enhanced with JS: Introducing and removing DOM elements or attributes 
such as inputs and class names respectively, allowing the multi step and progress bar functionality,
enabling the languaje dropdown selector functionality (like avoiding repetion and deleting inputs),
and some other features.

This was a good opportunity to apply my problem solving skills with javascript, taking advantage of the 
many built-in methods and functions that handle data and its structures. Creating functions and variables that play with
the HTML and CSS was an excelent way to grasp the full front-end web dev experience.
Also I further increased my knowledge and experience in creating a good scalable code (/*with comments*/).

As for HTML I continue to learn about the importance of containers and overall structure of a page,
also I learned a lot about forms, how they work, there input types and what elements and attributes are needed to make it submitable.

Lastly I keep falling in love with CSS. Further comprehending positioning and containers; fixed, relative and auto values;
pseudoclasses and its advantages; color theory; inheritance; variables and the scalability that they offer;
